=======

Vdw is a python library for van der Waals fluid calculations, based on
the formulation of [Johnston (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1205).

The library is fairly rudimentary at present.  Install it using `pip3 install`.
Read the docstrings for usage details.

Examples given in the `examples/` directory generate the following plots:
